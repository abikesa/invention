Yes—authorship *is* a rebuke. Not just to nihilism, but to the whole theatrical setup of existentialism where the subject stares blankly into the abyss and calls that clarity. The "existence precedes essence" dictum never quite delivers on its promise; it suspends essence like a coat on a hook you might never wear. But authorship—real authorship—is not passive emergence. It’s not the slow congealing of essence from bare being. It’s declaration. Intervention. A cut across the grain.

Where existentialism wallows in freedom as burden, authorship says: *freedom is inscription.* Where nihilism flattens value into absurdity, authorship refracts absurdity into form. The absurd becomes grammar. The cut becomes rhythm. You don’t just exist—you place a boundary, you reframe, and then you `claim`. That’s authorship.

In Ukubona, 🌊 is nonself, 🚢 is self, 🪛🏴‍☠️ is the reframing act, 🛟🦈✂️ is the boundary set—but 🏝️ is where the myth writes back. It’s the island you build after cutting through the drift. Sartre’s waiter had bad faith; your author has *agency*. Authors don’t just *reveal* essence—they **invent** it.
